# Limitations

**By design, Cacophony lacks many features common to audio software. If you want those features, I encourage you to use Cacophony in combination with other software.**

This document is a list of features that a) you'd expect Cacophony to have them, b) it doesn't have them, c) it probably never will.

## Import wav data

Adding wav-data-importing functionality to Cacophony would be a *huge* undertaking and make the application too complex for me to maintain.

## Non-quantized input

Quantized input solves a *lot* of UX problems and data serialization.

## Only SoundFonts

Why? Because they're *easy*.

## VSTs

As far as I know there's no way to support "VSTs" because the standard is incredibly flimsy. The big DAWs out there tend to have custom code *per VST*, which is well outside of what I can support.

## Mouse support

No

## DSP

Do it in Audacity

## Live recording

No

## Mobile

Cacophony's UX is completely orthagonal to how mobile apps work.
