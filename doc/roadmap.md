# Roadmap

This is like a list of [limitations](limitations.md) except that unlike that other list I *do* plan to add/fix these features.

## Fix bugs, I guess

Cacophony is a wee baby alpha and I'm just one developer. There are probably lots of bugs that need fixing.

## Improve Linux support

I wish this worked better than it did. Most of the Linux problems are due to issues in the rendering crate (Macroquad).

## Export to FLAC

Sorry, but FLAC support in Rust is really bad! Hopefully this will change soon.

## More languages

I'm don't know any other language well enough to provide localization but I'd really like it if Cacophony supported other languages.

## Better .sf3 support

...maybe?? Does anyone actually want this??

## Multiple MIDI controllers

idk seems like a good idea
