    <p><b>Cacophony is a minimalist and ergonomic MIDI sequencer.</b> It's minimalist in that it doesn't have a lot of functionality MIDI sequencers have. It's ergonomic in that there is no mouse input and a very clean interface, allowing you to juggle less inputs and avoid awkward mouse motions. <b>Cacophony is a proof-of-concept of a different way of making music.</b></p>
