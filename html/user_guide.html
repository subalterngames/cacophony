    <h1>User Guide</h1>
    <h2>How to run</h2>
    <p>Want to know how install Cacophony? <a href="install.html">Read this.</a></p>
    <p>On Windows and MacOS, just double-click the app.</p>
    <p>On Linux, you can't launch Cacophony by double-clicking the app. <b>I don't know why. Sorry.</b> To run Cacophony, open a terminal, type each of these, press enter each time:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><code>cd path_to/cacophony</code> (replace path_to with the actual path)</li>
        <li><code>./cacophony</code></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Get a SoundFont</h2>
    <p>You need to have at least one SoundFont .sf2 file on your computer. <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/">I like this site.</a></p>
    <p>Cacophony will initially look for SoundFonts in Documents/cacophony/soundfonts/ so it's usually a good idea to move them there, but you don't have to.</p>
    <h2>Add notes</h2>
    <p>Once you've added a track, loaded a SoundFont, cycled over to the piano roll, and armed the track, you can start adding notes.</p>
    <p>You can add notes from a MIDI controller or from a qwerty keyboard.</p>
    <p>Cacophony doesn't live-record your inputs. It halts and waits for you to do something. Once you add a note, it will be at a quantized start time, for a quantized duration; you can set the input beat duration from in the piano roll panel.</p>
    <p>To add silence between notes, enable Time mode in the piano roll panel and move the cursor.</p>
    <h2>Edit the config.ini file</h2>
    <p>Cacophony's font, color scheme, every keyboard binding, and lots of other settings, are in a config file. To edit the config file, first copy it from cacophony/data/config.ini to Documents/cacophony/config.ini (the app will always prefer the one in Documents/ if it exists). Feel free to experiment with editing the file. If you mess up you can always copy+paste the default file again.</p>
    <h2>Ask for help</h2>
    <p>I don't want to give too much away, but I'll say this: Casey the Cacodemon can talk to you via your computer's text-to-speech engine and tell you how to use the app. Try pressing F1, F2, F3, and F4.</p>
    <p>F1 Status and F2 Input are contextual; they'll tell you different things depending which panel you've selected, whether you've selected any notes, etc.</p>
