    <h1>Limitations</h1>
    <p>This is a non-exhaustive list of features that you might expect Cacophony to have that it'll never have. <b>By design, Cacophony lacks many features common to audio software. If you want those features, I encourage you to use Cacophony in combination with other software.</b></p>
    <h2>Can't import wav data</h2>
    <p>Adding wav-data-importing functionality to Cacophony would be a huge undertaking and make the application too complex for me to maintain.</p>
    <h2>Non-quantized input</h2>
    <p>Quantized input solves a lot of UX problems and data serialization. (Basically, I'm unwilling to serialize floats.)</p>
    <h2>Only SoundFonts</h2>
    <p>Why? Because they're easy.</p>
    <h2>No VSTs or other plugins</h2>
    <p>As far as I know you can't actually write a general audio plugin framework because the plugins vary too much. Pro DAWs apparently have custom code per VST, which is well beyond what I can support.</p>
    <h2>No mouse support</h2>
    <p>I won't add it.</p>
    <h2>No audio effects, filters, etc.</h2>
    <p>Do it in Audacity.</p>
    <h2>No live recording</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h2>No mobile app</h2>
    <p>Cacophony's UX is completely orthagonal to how mobile apps work.</p>
    <h2>No browser app</h2>
    <p>I MIGHT make this some day, but I don't think too much about it.</p>
