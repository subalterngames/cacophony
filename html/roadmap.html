    <h1>Roadmap</h1>
    <p>I really don't want to add new features to Cacophony. For a list of features I *won't* add, <a href="limitations.html">read this</a>.</p>
    <h2>Fix bugs, I guess?</h2>
    <p>I don't know if this is something you're supposed to add to a roadmap?</p>
    <p>Cacophony is a wee baby alpha and I'm just one developer. There are probably lots of bugs that need fixing. When you find them, please let me know.</p>
    <h2>FLAC</h2>
    <p>As far as I know there isn't any good Rust FLAC encoding code. Hopefully that'll change soon.</p>
    <h2>More Languages</h2>
    <p>If you'd like to translate Cacophony, please do so!! The language look-up table is in cacophony/data/text.csv</p>
    <h2>Better .sf3 support</h2>
    <p>...maybe?? Does anyone actually want this??</p>
