[QWERTY_BINDINGS]
# Input event bindings for a qwerty keyboard.
# Every input event must have a qwerty binding.
#
# Qwerty bindings must define the keys being pressed:
# {"keys": ["F1"]}
#
# You can optionally can define held mods: 
# {"keys": ["O"], "mods": ["LeftControl"]}
#
# You can optionally set the sensitivity, the number of frames until the app registers a repeat event:
# {"keys": ["PageUp"], "dt": 10} 
# If you don't set the dt value, key presses are detected only on press, not on held.
#
# For a list of key codes, see: <cacophony directory>/data/keycodes.txt
