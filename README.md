# Cacophony

**Cacophony is a minimalist and ergonomic MIDI sequencer.** It's minimalist in that it doesn't have a lot of functionality MIDI sequencers have. It's ergonomic in that there is no mouse input and a very clean interface, allowing you to juggle less inputs and avoid awkward mouse motions.

Cacophony is a proof-of-concept of an unusual way to create digital music.

I made Cacophony because I want to make music in a very particular way that I couldn't find anywhere.

Cacophony's mascot is Casey the Transgender Cacodemon. No official artwork of Casey exists because I don't want to be cursed.
